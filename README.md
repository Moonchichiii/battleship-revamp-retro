A complete overhaul of my original Python terminal game — now a full-blown web application with smart AI opponents, clean architecture, and a retro twist. This is my take on blending nostalgia with modern tech.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

Back in 2022, I wrote a simple terminal version of Battleship in Python. It was fun, but basic: random AI, no interface, and Google Sheets for saving scores.

Fast forward to 2025 — I wanted to challenge myself: take that humble script and turn it into something production-grade. This project is my playground for applying serious software practices, exploring AI algorithms, and shipping a real web app from scratch.

## ✨ What Makes It Cool

### 🤖 Smarter AI Opponents

I didn’t want to settle for dumb luck. The AI here actually thinks:

- **Rookie**: Just shoots randomly with a few tricks.
- **Veteran**: Uses probability heatmaps to make better guesses.
- **Admiral**: Runs Monte Carlo Tree Search simulations.
- **Legendary**: Learns your behavior and adapts over time.

### 🎨 Retro Aesthetic

I'm a sucker for old-school vibes — so I styled the interface like a classic CRT terminal:

- ASCII graphics, scan lines, and green-on-black goodness.
- Fully responsive, works on phones too.

### 🔐 GitHub Login & Player Stats

- OAuth 2.0 via GitHub.
- Each player gets a profile and match history.

### ⚡ Fast and Responsive

- Async FastAPI backend.
- HTMX for snappy, real-time interactions.
- Redis caching where it counts.

## 🛠 Stack I Used

| Area       | Tech Used                     |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| Backend    | Python, FastAPI, Redis, OAuth2 |
| Frontend   | HTMX, Jinja2, Vanilla JS, Tailwind CSS |
| Database   | PostgreSQL (prod), SQLite (dev) |
| DevOps     | Docker, CI/CD pipelines       |
| Testing    | Pytest, Black, Ruff, Mypy, Locust |

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/battleship-revamp-2025.git
cd battleship-revamp-2025

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your GitHub OAuth credentials

# Launch the app
python main.py
```

Now open your browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## 🎮 Evolution Timeline

| Year       | Milestone                                      |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 2022       | Terminal game with Google Sheets leaderboard  |
| 2025       | Full stack web app with CI/CD and OAuth       |

What started as a basic script is now a live, production-ready app with AI strategy layers and a custom UI. It's been a wild ride.

## 🧠 AI Details

Each difficulty level uses a different algorithm:

- **Rookie** – Simple heuristics.
- **Veteran** – Probabilistic targeting.
- **Admiral** – Monte Carlo simulations.
- **Legendary** – Adaptive logic with learning behavior.

It’s not just about difficulty — it’s about personality. Each opponent plays differently.
