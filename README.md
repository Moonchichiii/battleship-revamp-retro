## 1. Project Overview

### Brief Description

Battleship Revamp 2025 represents a comprehensive transformation from a simple Python terminal script to a full-stack web application. The project demonstrates modern software engineering practices, AI algorithm implementation, and production-grade deployment strategies.

Originally conceived as a basic terminal game in 2022 with random AI opponents and Google Sheets integration for score tracking, this iteration showcases advanced development methodologies including containerization, continuous integration, security scanning, and sophisticated AI decision-making algorithms.

### Target Audience

This project serves multiple constituencies:

- **Gaming Enthusiasts**: Players seeking intelligent opponents with varying difficulty levels and strategic depth
- **Developers**: Those interested in AI algorithm implementation, full-stack architecture, and modern deployment practices  
- **Technical Recruiters**: Demonstration of comprehensive software engineering skills across multiple domains
- **Students**: Learning resource for game development, AI implementation, and web application architecture

### Development Roadmap

The complete project roadmap and development tracking can be found on the [Battleship Revamp 2025 GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/users/Moonchichiii/projects/1).

## 2. Technical Architecture

### System Design

The application follows a modern, decoupled architecture pattern:

- **Backend API**: FastAPI-based RESTful service handling game logic, AI processing, and user management
- **Frontend Interface**: HTMX-powered dynamic interface with Jinja2 templating and Vanilla JavaScript
- **Authentication Layer**: OAuth 2.0 implementation via GitHub integration
- **Caching Layer**: Redis implementation for session management and performance optimization
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL for production environments, SQLite for development

### Authentication & Security

User authentication is implemented through GitHub OAuth 2.0, providing:
- Secure token-based authentication
- User profile synchronization
- Match history persistence
- Session management with Redis caching

### Performance Optimization

- **Asynchronous Processing**: FastAPI's async capabilities ensure non-blocking operations
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis implementation for frequently accessed data
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient query patterns and connection pooling
- **Static Asset Management**: Optimized delivery of CSS, JavaScript, and image assets

## 3. AI Implementation

The game features four distinct AI difficulty levels, each implementing different algorithmic approaches:

### Rookie Level
- **Algorithm**: Heuristic-based decision making
- **Behavior**: Random targeting with basic pattern recognition
- **Implementation**: Simple probability calculations with minimal state tracking

### Veteran Level  
- **Algorithm**: Probability heatmap analysis
- **Behavior**: Statistical targeting based on ship placement patterns
- **Implementation**: Dynamic probability matrix updates based on historical hit data

### Admiral Level
- **Algorithm**: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- **Behavior**: Simulation-based decision making with lookahead capabilities
- **Implementation**: Multi-threaded simulation runs with optimized tree traversal

### Legendary Level
- **Algorithm**: Adaptive machine learning integration
- **Behavior**: Pattern recognition and behavioral adaptation
- **Implementation**: Player behavior analysis with dynamic strategy adjustment

Each AI level maintains distinct personality characteristics, ensuring varied gameplay experiences while providing appropriate challenge scaling.
