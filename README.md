## 1. Project Overview

### Current state (implemented)

- FastAPI app with HTMX/Jinja2 templates
- Minimal in-memory game engine (random fleet placement, hits/misses, simple stats)
- Dev hygiene: Black, Ruff, mypy, pre-commit (hooks enforced)
- GitHub Actions: CI (lint+tests), **Security** (Trivy + Docker Scout), **Deploy** (Render) chained after Security

### Planned

- Real auth (OAuth/social logins), persistent users/scores
- Smarter AI levels (beyond random)
- PostgreSQL persistence & Redis cache

### Brief Description

Battleship Revamp 2025 represents a comprehensive transformation from a simple Python terminal script to a full-stack web application. The project demonstrates modern software engineering practices, AI algorithm implementation, and production-grade deployment strategies.

Originally conceived as a basic terminal game in 2022 with random AI opponents and Google Sheets integration for score tracking, this iteration showcases advanced development methodologies including containerization, continuous integration, security scanning, and sophisticated AI decision-making algorithms.

### Target Audience

This project serves multiple constituencies:

- **Gaming Enthusiasts**: Players seeking intelligent opponents with varying difficulty levels and strategic depth
- **Developers**: Those interested in AI algorithm implementation, full-stack architecture, and modern deployment practices
- **Technical Recruiters**: Demonstration of comprehensive software engineering skills across multiple domains
- **Students**: Learning resource for game development, AI implementation, and web application architecture

---

## 2. Technical Architecture

### System Design

- **Backend API:** FastAPI + Starlette
- **UI:** Jinja2 + HTMX (server-rendered with partials)
- **State:** In-memory (per process) for now

**Planned:**

- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 (e.g., GitHub/Google)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (prod), SQLite (dev)
- **Caching:** Redis (sessions/caching)

### Performance considerations

- In use: FastAPI's async request handling (non-blocking I/O)
- *(Planned)* Redis caching for hot paths
- *(Planned)* DB connection pooling and query tuning
- *(Planned)* Optimized static asset delivery

---

## 3. AI Implementation

The game will feature tiered AI difficulty levels, each using different algorithmic approaches:

### Implemented now

- **Rookie:** basic random/heuristic behavior, simple stats

### Planned tiers

- **Veteran:** probability heatmap targeting
- **Admiral:** search/lookahead (e.g., heuristic-driven)

Each AI level maintains distinct personality characteristics, ensuring varied gameplay experiences while providing appropriate challenge scaling.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moonchichiii/battleship-revamp-2025.git
cd battleship-revamp-2025

python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker compose up --build
```

Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Environment Variables

_Note: The app runs without DB/OAuth today; these variables are for future use.

Create a `.env` file with the following configuration:

```env
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# GitHub OAuth
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret

# Application Settings

## 7. Testing & Quality Assurance

```bash
# Format
black .

# Lint (auto-fix)
ruff check --fix .

# Type check
mypy .

# Tests (with coverage)
pytest -q --cov --cov-report=term-missing

# Run all hooks on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Testing Strategy

The project implements comprehensive testing across multiple layers:

#### Unit Testing

```bash
# Run all unit tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run tests with coverage reporting
pytest tests/ --cov=src/ --cov-report=html
```

#### Performance Testing

```bash
# Load testing with Locust
locust -f tests/performance/locustfile.py --host=http://localhost:8000
```

### Security Testing

Automated security scanning is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

- **Trivy**: Container vulnerability scanning
- **Docker Scout**: Dependency vulnerability assessment
- **SAST**: *(planned)* Static application security testing

---

## 8. CI/CD & Security

### Workflows

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Black, Ruff, mypy, pytest (+ coverage)
- **Security** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`): build once â†’ scan with **Trivy** (fail High/Critical + upload SARIF) and **Docker Scout** (fail High/Critical)
- **Deploy** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`): triggers on `workflow_run` after **Security** succeeds for a push to `main`; builds & pushes image to Render and triggers deploy.

### Recommended branch protection

- Require checks from **CI** and **Security** before merging to `main`.
